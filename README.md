# Remember Random

A tool for remembering you of pieces of text.

Everyday we are exposed to a vast quantity of information. But if we are exposed
to this information only once we hardly will be able to record it. This tool
solves that by allowing one to mark pieces of text to be remembered afterwards.

## Config example:

Place the config in ~/.remember_config
```sh
global.tmp_file=/tmp/remember_random_file
glossary.file_path=/home/jean/projects/wiki/src/glossary.md
glossary.separator=new_line
remember.file_path=/home/jean/.remember
remember.separator=new_line
quotes.file_path=/home/jean/projects/wiki/src/quotes.md
quotes.separator=tree_dashes
wiki.file_path=/home/jean/projects/wiki/src
wiki.separator=emphasis_blocks
```
